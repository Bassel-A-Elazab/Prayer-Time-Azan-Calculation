# Prayer-Time-Azan-Calculation

# What is Azan?
It is the Islamic call to prayer, recited by the muezzin (the person) at prescribed times of the day.

# How is azan calculates ?
There are many different resources in calculating prayer time for Muslims , but  all the resources depend on common equation and under one concept in Astronomy science.<br/>
because I'm a programmer I don't need more details in Astronomy science - more complex definition on it, I searched - I founded many resources as in a references [1],[2] <br/>
and there are many APIs that were applied, but I Found  a reference [3] and its seems different for another and its looks like easy , simple , basic to code it. 

# Code Usage
Im coding using c++ programming language and I made program that's easy to modify on it - I made it global to calculate any prayer time belongs to any country<br/>
just change main variables like ( Longitude , Latitude , TimeZone , Height Above the Sea , Dawn’s Twilight Angle , Night’s Twilight Angle ).
